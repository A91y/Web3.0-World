What is ERC ?
ERC is basically stands for the Ethereum Request for Comments. Itâ€™s like technical documents that define the methods, behaviors, innovation, and research applicable to a group of developers and users who want to utilize the Ethereum ecosystem.

ERC-20, ERC-721, and ERC-1155 appear as the three popular ERC token standards or protocols that have their applications across major industries. The Ethereum community fully approves these token standards, and they differ in terms of specific features and functionalities.
