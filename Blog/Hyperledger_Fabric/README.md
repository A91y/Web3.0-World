### Before we dive into hyperledger fabric we need to understand what Hyperledger is?

# Hyperledger
It is not a blockchain, neither it is a cryptocurrency nor a company instead it is an open source blockchain technology that provides framework and tools.

# Introduction



We have come across different blockchains like bitcoin, ethereum, solana, etc. but there is one common thing that all these Blockchain shares; nodes store
a complete copy of the distributed ledger and are responsible for the reliability of the stored data. In case a company wants use the blockchain, 
every random node cannot be trusted with the data. Therefore, when these corporations are collaborating with each other it comes at the expense of
inefficient procedures that may compromise security, time and resources of the companies. Besides these companies don't want there competing companies
to steal their data and strategies therefore in this case blockchain fails. Here, we need some better option so that we can manipulate blockchain at the
same time we may not want every node to store the data. Hence, hyperledger fabric project was led. Hyperleger fabric a global collaboration, hosted by 
The Linux Foundation, and includes member organizations that are leaders in finance, banking, Internet of Things, supply chains, manufacturing, and
technology. All the bigger like intel and IBM are manipulating hyperleger fabric these days. That suggests it has gained immense popularity in a very sort 
span.
