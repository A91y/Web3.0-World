|Sal -dApp| This decentralized application solves the problem of multiple hands involved in the simple task of paying employees. In startups/companies we see that a specific team is involved to manage salaries of employees that can simply be done by a single person. So using this application we allow a single person/admin to pay all of their employees at once on basis of the position they are working on. This would save a lot of resources for a startup/company as the task done by a team can now be done by a single person.|Not done | |
| Medical record | Securing Medical record using Blockchain	This project will store the patient's record on the blockchain network public key ECC encrypted form. The product will be designed in such a way only patients or the hospital can see the medical record. The product will use a Symmetric key, asymmetric, and hashes.| Not Done | | 
|Fake Product detection |Fake Product detection using blockchain	Fake product is a big challenge for every industry, may it be the pharmaceutical, electronics, or food industry. This project aims to tackle to problem of fake products by adding QR to the products, information about which will be stored on the blockchain immutably. Alongside the blockchain will also contain information about the current owner of the product so that can be verified by the user whether they are purchasing from a legitimate source or not.| Not Done | |    
|Brain Tumor detection | Brain Tumor detection using Machine Learning and Blockchain	Brain tumour detection, we will use Machine Learning to detect the tumour in the brain and Blockchain for a secure database. In the Blockchain, we will be saving patients' records. The objective of this research paper will be to provide a solution to detect brain tumours at their early stages.	Research paper	Machine Learning, Python Language, Blockchain Development, Image processing and Artificial Intelligence.| Not Done | | 
| social-media platforms| decentralized system on social-media platforms using BLOCKCHAIN	This project is basically bringing and introducing decentralized system using Blockchain refers to the transfer of control and decision-making from a centralized entity (individual, organization, or group thereof) to a distributed network as Decentralized networks strive to increase the level of trust that participants must place in one another, and deter their ability to exert authority or control over one another in ways that degrade the functionality of the network.| Not done | |
| Decentralised-Swap| Centralized exchanges require the user to verify themselves and the transaction between any two buyers and sellers involves an intermediary. Decentralised-Swap is a decentralized exchange over ethereum wherein the transaction takes place directly between the buyer and seller. This removes the intermediary and the KYC requirement which otherwise would need to be done in centralized exchanges. This is one of the core concepts of decentralization, which states trustless transactions. Decentralised-Swap is a simple user friendly DApp built using Solidity for smart contracts| Not done | | 
| Chating application | This will remive the messanger or any chat application which is based on the web2 . The main aim of adding this project is to remove the centralised part  with Decentralised one . This apllication  is p2p site . | Not Done | |
